Produced by C. V. Kumar under his Thirukumaran Entertainment banner, with K. E. Gnanavel Raja also co-producing the film under Studio Green, it stars Vijay Sethupathi with Madonna Sebastian, the latter in her Tamil film debut.[2] It is an official remake of the 2010 Korean film My Dear Desperado.[3]

The film focuses about a rowdy and an IT professional whom share a special bond when they live as neighbours. Nalan Kumarasamy initially developed the script as a dark comedy; however as several other films were being released in the same genre, he rewrote the entire script from scratch which spent him two years. The principal shooting of the film began in April 2015 and ended that July, with film being set mostly in Chennai.
